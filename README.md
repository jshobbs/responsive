## Responsive Web Design Page
This is a responsive web page that provides my accomplishments and links to my Github projects.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap were used to create this page. Bootstrap grid layout
classes and CSS media queries were used to make the page display properly on all screen sizes.

To use the page, just open index.html in a browser. The 4 image files are included in the project.
